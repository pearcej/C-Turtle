# C-Turtle -- LEGACY REPO
#### This repository exists to reflect the original project structure prior to being in a single header!
#### Maintanence is not planned for this repository. To stay up to date, it is recommended that the master branch is used to avoid bugs that have been fixed in more recent releases.
#### [Documentation](https://walkerje.github.io/C-Turtle/docs/index.html)
#### [Setup / Installation](https://walkerje.github.io/C-Turtle/docs/md__home_jesse_Development_Work_C-Turtle-Doxy_setup.html)

C-Turtle is a port of Python's Turtle facility for C++11, with the intent of being a close analog to the Python implementation. This package was developed with the intent of student usage under an academic setting, and was designed to be "as easy to use as possible"â„¢. This package has been released under the MIT license accordingly.
Given that this is intended to be an education-oriented package, there is a comprehensive and guided setup process available [here](https://walkerje.github.io/C-Turtle/docs/md__home_jesse_Development_Work_C-Turtle-Doxy_setup.html) to ease the process. CMake 3.1 is or greater is required for the setup process.

This package heavily uses [CImg](http://cimg.eu/) for its display and drawing functions.

## Direct Comparison between C++ and Python
The following table contains examples, which do the exact same thing, between C-Turtle and Python's Turtle.
